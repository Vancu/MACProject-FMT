## App Description
Find My Track is an app focused on giving those who need bus/train routes and stop locations an easy to use program that consolidates nearby schedules all in one place, allowing easy access and skipping complicated methods for accessing bus information. Scheduling, alarms, and notifications are the main pull and focus.

## App Design
We strive for a minimalistic UI for ease of access, using databases to store local data and to retrieve them for no data storage on the user's part. Maps and coordinates will be pulled for easier information, and combined with the easy to use UI will give a pleasant user experience for all. Stored schedules can be accessed offline for quick access on buses/trains through the app.

## Users
We're focusing on more local students for Merced, but we want a later focus on a more global population for using the app, by first starting with local cities close to Merced, then expanding to more metro areas.

## Impact
This will help by making those who use it better at planning and scheduling their work or school week, giving a more ease of mind with accurate and fast data. Examples include solving the issue of figuring out which bus to take given a multitude of options with no clear way to determine clearly which is the better option to take. Another example can be being able to determine the right bus to arrive to x location from current location.
